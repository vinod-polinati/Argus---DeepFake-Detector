**Deep Fake Detection Streamlit App**

This code creates a Streamlit web application for deep fake detection. Users can upload images or videos and select deep fake detection models to analyze the content. The application provides a user-friendly interface with options to review and submit analysis results.

**Getting Started**

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone 
   ```
2. Create a virtual environment and install required dependencies:
   ```bash
   python -m venv env
   source env/bin/activate  # For Linux/macOS
   env\Scripts\activate.bat  # For Windows
   pip install streamlit opencv-python Pillow requests [other_dependencies]
   ```
   Replace `[other_dependencies]` with any additional dependencies required by your deep fake detection models.
3. Place your pre-trained deep fake detection models in the appropriate directory within the project structure.
4. Run the Streamlit app:
   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

**Further Development**

- Integrate deep fake detection models and implement analysis logic.
- Enhance the review and submission functionality (e.g., connect to a backend server).
- Error handling and user feedback for deep fake detection results.
- Consider adding functionalities like download analysis reports.
